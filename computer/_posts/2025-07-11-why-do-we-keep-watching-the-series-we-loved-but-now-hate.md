have you ever started watching a very good series, and then it lost the initial
quality that it had, but you kept watching?

# netflix shows are awful, or will become awful
netflix shows sometimes start very promising. the plot, story telling and
the directing seems awesome.

after a season or two, the show starts to corrupt. its pretty obvious that
they've reached the success they was looking for. they got the people hooked,
and they won't care about the quality of the show anymore.

i think the very reason of this, is that once people start watching a show, they
never stop. they wanna see what will happen. this makes very sense tho, you have
watched this much, why shouldn't you just finish it?

# ruining your self-esteem
the negative effect of this on your self self-esteem is obvious. you hate the
show. you used to love it, but now its not good at all. so why do you keep doing
something you hate?

its the sense of curiosity that drives you now; you also need to finish
something once you've started it. finishing a series is one of the easiest
thigns on earth to do. so to fulfil curiosity and sense of accomplishment you
keep going on and hating yourself for it.

# the switch to hate-watching
when you start to absolutely hate the show, to lose that sense of wasting your
time, you switch your genuine interest into hate-watching.

hate-watching is a mentally destructive activity; wasting your time on something
you absolutely hate, and feel overpowered by the fact that you can mock it. its
exactly like how condescending people satisfy their ego; by feeling superior to
others just because they can say something that in their own delusional head
makes the other person less.

# the solution?
- don't watch series. watch movies that won't get any sequel. you know the type
- watch series, but as the series start to corrupt, imagine your own ending for
  it. the series has ended, in your heart. its over. you can now call it a day
- detect hate-watching and stop it right away. don't feel superior because you
know how shitty the series is; ofc the director knows that too, but you're just
feeling their pocket by wasting your time and mental energy at that point
